Channelot - Terminal and Job IO for Lua Coroutines                   *channelot*

Channelot is a library plugin for operating Neovim jobs from a Lua
coroutine. It supports:

 * Starting jobs, with and without terminals.
 * Starting multiple jobs on the same Neovim terminal.
 * Job control is done via Lua coroutines - Channelot will resume the
   coroutine once the job is finished and/or when it outputs new data.

Channelot was created as a supplemental plugin for Moonicipal
(https://github.com/idanarye/nvim-moonicipal), but can be used independent
of it.

ChannelotTerminal                                            *ChannelotTerminal*
    Represents a terminal - a buffer that can handle PTY IO.

    A single terminal can run multiple jobs. To only run a single job, prefer
    |channelot.terminal_job|.

    See: ~
        |channelot.terminal|


A terminal is created in the current buffer, so it is advisable to create
a new buffer in a new split first. Unlike regular Neovim terminals that
prompt for exit automatically when the process is finished,
ChannelotTerminal can run multiple jobs so it needs to prompt the user
manually to be closed.
